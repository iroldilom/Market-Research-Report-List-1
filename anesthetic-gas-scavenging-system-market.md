<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthetic Gas Scavenging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anesthetic gas scavenging systems are essential for managing waste anesthetic gases in clinical settings. The active type employs suction mechanisms, efficiently collecting and removing hazardous gases from the operating room, ensuring a safer environment for staff and patients. In contrast, passive systems rely on natural airflow and gravity, directing gases away from work areas without mechanical assistance. Both types serve to minimize exposure to anesthetic agents, but active systems typically provide more effective control in high-risk environments.</p></p>
