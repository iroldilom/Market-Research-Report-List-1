<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Collamer Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Astigmatism Lens</li><li>Non-Astigmatism Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) market is categorized into two main types: astigmatism lenses and non-astigmatism lenses. Astigmatism lenses are designed to correct refractive errors caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, providing sharper vision for individuals with this condition. Non-astigmatism lenses, on the other hand, are aimed at correcting myopia or hyperopia without addressing astigmatism. Both types offer an effective alternative to laser vision correction, catering to diverse patient needs and preferences within the refractive surgery landscape.</p></p>
